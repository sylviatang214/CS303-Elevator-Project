**Assumption:** 
Single & Multiple elevators case:
- The elevator each has a direction it's going in, either up or down. This determines which floor call can be picked up since user outside elevator
- Once the user is in
can always presses either up or down button.
Multiple elevators case:
- Since users outside of the elevator might press both up and down buttons, assign each user to different elevator that is closest to them and is in
the same direction as their button choice.
